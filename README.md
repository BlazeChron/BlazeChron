I like game dev and am learning databases and sysadmin.

Currently working on a game project called fish_game, a short fishing game to implement databases with

Betrayal Seven is on the backburner for now T-T.

You can find my games on itch at https://blazechron.itch.io/

I am also working on a personal website:
https://blazechron.github.io/

Planning to fully convert it into threejs, as well as to implement a database.
