I game dev! You can find my games on itch at https://blazechron.itch.io/

I am currently learning databases on a self-hosted server, and making too many discord bots...

Ongoing Projects:
- fish_game, a simple fishing game to implement databases with (with a Discord Bot interface)
- Betrayal Seven, a single player card game (Godot, on the backburner for now T-T)
- Converting my [personal website](https://blazechron.github.io/) to threejs
